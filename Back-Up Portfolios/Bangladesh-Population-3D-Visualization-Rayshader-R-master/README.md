# Population Density 3D Visualization - Bangladesh

This R script generates a 3D population density map for Bangladesh using various R packages and data sources. The visualization is created using the rayshader package, developed by Tyler Morgan-Wall, and is based on population data from the Kontur Population dataset.

### Packages

The following R packages were instrumental in creating this visualization:

- **tidyverse**
- **sf**
- **tmap**
- **ggplot2**
- **mapview**
- **stars**
- **rayshader**
- **MetBrewer**
- **colorspace**
- **rayrender**
- **magick**
- **extrafont**
